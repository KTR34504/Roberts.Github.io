<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello and Welcome to my GitHub Page!</h1>
<p> I will be taking you through the projects I have completed and outlining the experience I've gained from them. </p>

<h2> Network Infrastructure </h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"> This project was assigned to me during my studies. This project aimed to set up a network from scratch and separate it into two networks using two different network management protocols. I set up the staff computers using the provided subnet masks and IP addresses </p>
<h3> Network Security </h3>

<p style="text-align: center;"> (Zoom for a better view.) </p> 
<p> I built my own SIEM through Microsoft Azure. I then added Microsoft Sentinel and set security rules to generate alerts for malicious activity that it may pick up. This sharpened my knowledge and familiarity with security tools and mitigation, preparing me to recognize and remediate network, system, or Web server threats. In the future, I plan to add MISP to the SIEM. </p>
